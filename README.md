# Your Weather

A responsive web site to empower users as individuals by providing weather information no matter where they are in the world!

## Description

This site combines jQuery, a geocoding api, and a weathermapping api to provide information based on user inputs. The apis provide the information that translate to the page while the jQuery enables users to pinpoint what information they may require. 

### How to Use

Your Weather provides a friendly user interface that allows simple commands to achieve desired output. 
By simply searching by location in the search bar or dragging and location pin on the provided map, You Weather will retrieve the information that is needed to inform the user based on the request.
